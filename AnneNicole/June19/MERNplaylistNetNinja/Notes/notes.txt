1) Identify the entities involved in the e-commerce platform, such as customers, products, categories, orders, and reviews.

Customers
-First name
-Last name
-Email address
-Phone number
-Delivery address
-Payment method

products
-products selling

categories
-product category

orders
-in cart basket
-past orders
-cancelled orders

Reviews
-star rating given
-written reviews given
-photos/videos of product for review



2) Determine the relationships between these entities and define the cardinality of each relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).

Customers (one to many)
Products (one to many)
Categories (one to many)
Orders (one to many)
Reviews (one to many)




3) Design a data model using either the embedded or reference approach based on the following requirements:
 a. Customers can place multiple orders, and each order can contain multiple products. 
 b. Each product belongs to a specific category, and a category can have multiple products. 
 c. Customers can write reviews for products, and each product can have multiple reviews.
